# TDD Assignment

You are a programmer for Penguin Chat. While we all love freedom of speech, and can appreciate good curse word,
a user named KarenLady123 has been complaining non-stop about profanity being used on the website. We need you 
to replace curse words with symbols automatically if a user types them. You can find a list of these words in the
data folder in a file called "words.js".

Please use TDD in order to solve this problem and save PenguinChat from KarenLady123 suing us into oblivion while
still allowing our users to express themselves.
